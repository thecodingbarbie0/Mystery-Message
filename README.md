## About

***Mashh()*** is a less "customizable" and bare bones play on the old school game MASH.

Mansion. Apartment. Shack. House. 

To play, simply call the function:

    mashh();

This function will randomly output your future:
+ City and State
+ Number of Kids
+ Marital Status

And of course, 
+ Mansion, Apartment, Shack, House, or the mystery 'h'
